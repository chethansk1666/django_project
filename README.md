 My project Natural Disaster Management System  involves distribution of foods, cloths properly to natural disaster caused places.
 India’s size and diversity makes it one of the the most disaster-prone countries in Asia. 
 Large coastal areas in the south suffer from cyclones, while the northern mountainous areas suffer from landslides and floods, and droughts regularly affect the country’s central region. Every year, these result in a huge loss of lives, damage infrastructure, and disrupt vital services. The country’s National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) has just announced plans to build a national disaster database by 2020, which it hopes will help minimise the impact. 
 With this natural disaster project we are able to give overall funds received to the government of Karnataka.
 We are to give store all the user information those able who are donating money for floods caused places.
 our database able to predict the cost management, proper distribution of foods medicines, cloths etc. 
 Finally our database able to give overall money spent to all disaster caused places. In project user can also give feedback for supplied food and cloths that they have received good quality of products. Our web app will  also gives the information about migrated people so that government can easily transfer funds, medicines, foods  to the people.   A major hurdle during the design of the project was displaying the web page of the Natural Disaster Management System.  In our project we are using Django python web framework for web designing. 
 Django is works on the principle of don’t repeat your yourself. For this database we are building dynamic web app.
 Since we are using python we are also able to plot graph pie charts and we are also using FusionChart.
 We are also using pandas for arranging data. Our web app consists of several forms for user requirements so that user can submit there feedback.
